<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Minitubers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional</li><li>Micro Propagation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Minitubers are small, pre-sprouted tubers that serve as planting material for potato production. The conventional market involves traditional propagation methods, where tubers are grown directly in fields, leading to larger-scale cultivation. In contrast, the micropropagation market employs advanced tissue culture techniques to produce disease-free, uniform planting material in a controlled environment. This method ensures higher quality and yields, addressing disease management and improving potato genetics. Both markets cater to diverse agricultural needs, enhancing potato production efficiency.</p></p>
