<p><ul><li>Single Tank</li><li>Dual Tanks</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The portable carpet cleaner market is primarily divided into two types: single tank and dual tank systems. Single tank cleaners combine clean and dirty water in one reservoir, making them lightweight and easier to handle, but potentially less efficient at separating dirty water. Dual tank systems, on the other hand, feature separate tanks for clean and dirty water, ensuring more effective cleaning and prevention of dirt redepositing onto carpets. This distinction influences user preference based on cleaning needs and convenience.</p></p>
