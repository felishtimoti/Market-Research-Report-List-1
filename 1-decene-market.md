<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 1-Decene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oligomerization Method</li><li>Cracking Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 1-Decene market encompasses two primary production methods: oligomerization and cracking. The oligomerization method involves the catalytic conversion of smaller alkenes, such as ethylene, into larger molecules like 1-Decene, resulting in high purity and better control over the product's properties. In contrast, the cracking method breaks down larger hydrocarbons into smaller molecules, including 1-Decene, but may produce a less uniform product. Both methods cater to various applications, including detergents, lubricants, and plastic additives.</p></p>
