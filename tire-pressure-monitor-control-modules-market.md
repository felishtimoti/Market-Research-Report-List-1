<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tire Pressure Monitor Control Modules Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wheel-Speed Based(Indirect TPMS)</li><li>Pressure-Sensor Based(Direct TPMS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Tire Pressure Monitor Control Modules market consists of two main types: Wheel-Speed Based (Indirect TPMS) and Pressure-Sensor Based (Direct TPMS). Indirect TPMS uses wheel speed sensors to estimate tire pressure by monitoring rotational wheel dynamics. In contrast, Direct TPMS employs pressure sensors within each tire to measure the actual air pressure directly. Both systems enhance vehicle safety by alerting drivers to pressure issues, but the direct method offers more accurate, real-time data about tire conditions.</p></p>
