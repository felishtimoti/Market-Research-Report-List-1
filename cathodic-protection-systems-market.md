<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cathodic Protection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Galvanic</li><li>Impressed Current</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cathodic protection systems are essential for preventing corrosion in structures like pipelines and tanks. The market is primarily divided into two types: galvanic systems and impressed current systems. Galvanic systems utilize sacrificial anodes made of more reactive metals, naturally protecting the structure by corroding first. In contrast, impressed current systems use an external power source to provide a constant electrical current, enabling more efficient protection over larger areas. Both methods serve critical roles in safeguarding infrastructure and extending its lifespan.</p></p>
