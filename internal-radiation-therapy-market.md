<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Internal Radiation Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brachytherapy</li><li>Systemic Radiation Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Internal radiation therapy involves the delivery of targeted radiation directly to cancerous tissues. The two primary types are brachytherapy and systemic radiation therapy. Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive sources within or near tumors, allowing for high doses of radiation with minimal impact on surrounding healthy tissue. Systemic radiation therapy uses radioactive substances that travel through the bloodstream to target cancer cells throughout the body, effectively treating widespread cancer while minimizing damage to non-cancerous cells. Both methods enhance treatment precision and patient outcomes.</p></p>
