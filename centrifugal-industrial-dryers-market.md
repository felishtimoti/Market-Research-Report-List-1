<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centrifugal Industrial Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct</li><li>Indirect</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centrifugal industrial dryers are categorized into direct and indirect types based on their heat transfer methods. Direct dryers introduce hot air directly into the material, enabling rapid moisture evaporation. This method is efficient for liquid-rich materials but may risk product contamination. Indirect dryers, on the other hand, use heat exchangers to transfer heat without direct contact with the material, ensuring product integrity. Each type serves specific applications, depending on moisture content, material characteristics, and desired product quality.</p></p>
